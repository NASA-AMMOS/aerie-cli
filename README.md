## Installation

### Installation with `pip`

Assuming you have Python installed on your system, you can install `aerie-cli` with the following command:

```
python -m pip install git+https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/397/aerie-cli.git#main
```

Note: if `python` points to a system-provided Python 2 installation, you should instead use `python3`.

You can confirm that `aerie-cli` has been installed on your system:

```
>>> which aerie-cli
> path/to/aerie-cli
```

### Installation with `poetry`

If you use `poetry` for your dependency management and intend to use this package in another Python project, you can install this package to an existing `poetry` project with:

```
poetry add git+https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/397/aerie-cli.git#main
```

For more info on `poetry`, see the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.
